# How do basketball Teams win games? 
# While searching for an answer to that question, Dean Oliver identified what he called the "Four Factors of Basketball Success":
#
# Shooting (40#)
# Turnovers (25#)
# Rebounding (20#)
# Free Throws (15#)
#
# Shooting
# The shooting factor is measured using Effective Field Goal Percentage (eFG#). 
# The formula for both offense and defense is (FG + 0.5 * 3P) / FGA.
#
# Turnovers
# The turnover factor is measured using Turnover Percentage (TOV#). 
# The formula for both offense and defense is TOV / (FGA + 0.44 * FTA + TOV).
#
# Rebounding
# The rebounding factor is measured using Offensive and Defensive Rebound Percentage (ORB# and DRB#, respectively). 
# The formula for offense is ORB / (ORB + Opp DRB), while the formula for defense is DRB / (Opp ORB + DRB). 
#
# Free Throws
# The free throw factor is a measure of both how often a Team gets to the line and how often they make them. 
# The formula for both offense and defense is FT / FGA.
#
# Basic Possession Formula=0.96*[(Field Goal Attempts)+(Turnovers)+0.44*(Free Throw Attempts)-(Offensive Rebounds)]
# What are the .44 and .96 Multipliers?
# .44 multiplier has to be taken into account because not all free throws take up a possession. 
# Technical foul shots along with “and 1’s” do not, while there are more than two free throws on one possession with a three-shot foul. 
# Research has determined that about 44# of all free throws take up possessions. 
# The .96 multiplier accounts for Team offensive rebounds in situations where a missed shot is tipped out of bounds by a defensive player, 
# continuing the possession without an offensive rebound being credited.
